# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation & Uplift Modeling for Retail Promotion Strategy

## 📌 Project Overview

This project leverages historical retail transaction data to identify customer segments and evaluate the impact of promotional discounts on sales. By combining unsupervised learning (KMeans clustering) with rule-based personas and uplift modeling, we generate insights to optimize targeting, timing, and discount strategy for personalized marketing.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Segment customers based on transactional behavior and demographics
- Estimate price elasticity for each segment and product category
- Evaluate uplift in revenue from promotional discounts
- Present findings through an interactive Power BI dashboard

---

## 🗂️ Data Sources

The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle Retail Transaction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fahadrehman07/retail-transaction-dataset) and includes:

- `CustomerID`, `ProductID`, `ProductCategory`
- `Quantity`, `Price`, `TotalAmount`, `DiscountApplied(%)`
- `Competitor Price`, `Seasonal Factor`, `TransactionDate`

---

## 🔍 Methodology

### 1. **Data Preparation**
- Cleaned and standardized transaction data
- One-hot encoded categorical variables
- Engineered features: `Revenue`, `Treatment`, `Elasticity`, `Uplift`

### 2. **Customer Segmentation**
- Applied KMeans clustering (k=7) on normalized behavioral features
- Labeled each customer with a `Segment`

### 3. **Rule-Based Persona Assignment**
- Defined personas using spend level, discount sensitivity, elasticity, and category preference:
  - **Loyal Spenders**
  - **Discount Hunters**
  - **Impulse Buyers**
  - **Functional Deal Seekers**
  - **Low-Value Drifters**

### 4. **Uplift Modeling**
- Two-model regression approach:
  - Model 1: Revenue for treated group (promo applied)
  - Model 2: Revenue for control group (no promo)
- Computed uplift as: `Predicted_Treated - Predicted_Control`

### 5. **Persona × Product Strategy Mapping**
- Mapped each persona to their best-performing product category
- Identified combinations with high uplift and low elasticity loss

The final output includes a multi-page Power BI report featuring:

- 🔹 Marketing Overview
- 🔹 Sales Overview 
- 🔹 Promo Effect Overview
- 🔹 Customer Segmentation profile
- 🔹 Strategic recommendations matrix
